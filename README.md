File Compression and Decompression Using Huffman and RLE Algorithms

Overview

This project implements efficient file compression and decompression algorithms using Huffman Coding and Run-Length Encoding (RLE). It is designed to reduce file sizes for both text and images while ensuring accurate restoration of the original files during decompression. The project also includes a web-based user interface for ease of access.

Features

Compression: Reduces file sizes using Huffman Coding and RLE algorithms for different file types.
Decompression: Restores files to their original form with minimal time overhead.
Supports Multiple Formats:
Text files (.txt)
Image files (.png, .jpg)
Performance Metrics: Displays compression ratio, processing time, and space savings.
User-Friendly Interface: Includes an interactive web application using Flask for uploading, compressing, and downloading files.
